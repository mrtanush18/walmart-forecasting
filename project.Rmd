# Read the Excel file
file_path <- "C:/Users/tanus/Downloads/BF assign 7/Walmart_Sales.xlsx"
sales_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Walmart_Sales")

# Display the first few rows to understand the structure
head(sales_data)

# Convert Date column to Date type
sales_data$Date <- as.Date(sales_data$Date)

# Aggregate Weekly_Sales across all stores
agg_sales <- aggregate(Weekly_Sales ~ Date, data = sales_data, sum)

# View the first few rows of the aggregated data
head(agg_sales)

# Create a time series object for the aggregated Weekly_Sales (to see total sales across all stores)

# It looks like there is a clear pattern of seasonality in your sales data. Here are some observations:
# 
# Regular Fluctuations: The data shows regular ups and downs within each year, which suggests a seasonal pattern.
# 
# Significant Peaks: There are noticeable spikes in sales around the beginning of 2011 and 2012. These peaks might indicate seasonal events or promotions that occur at the same time each year.

# Fit an ARIMA model automatically
arima_model <- auto.arima(sales_ts)

# Display the ARIMA model details
summary(arima_model)


### Analysis:
# 1. **Seasonality**: The term ((0,1,0)[52]) indicates seasonal differencing with a period of 52, suggesting a yearly seasonal component in the data.

# 2. The forecast errors are high (RMSE and MAE are large), suggesting that the model may not fully capture the volatility of the sales data.
# 
# 3. The AIC and BIC values are close, but since they are large, it could indicate that there might be room for model improvement (e.g., using a higher-order ARIMA or adding external regressors like holidays or promotions).

### Residual analysis

# Extract residuals from the ARIMA model
residuals <- residuals(arima_model)

# Plot residuals
plot(residuals, main = "Residuals of ARIMA Model", ylab = "Residuals", xlab = "Time", col = "red")

# Model Fit: The presence of non-random residuals indicates that there are aspects of the data that the model hasn't fully explained. 
# 
# Unexplained Volatility: The large spikes and dips might point to specific events or outliers that were not accounted for. Identifying and understanding these could help improve the model.

# Plot ACF of residuals to check for autocorrelation
acf(residuals, main = "ACF of Residuals")

# Since most of the bars fall within the confidence intervals, it indicates that the residuals are mostly random beyond the first lag. This means the ARIMA model has done a good job of capturing the main structure of the data.

# Perform Ljung-Box test to check for autocorrelation in the residuals
Box.test(residuals, lag = 52, type = "Ljung-Box") # Lag 52 for weekly seasonality

# The p-value is 0.5284, which is greater than the common significance levels (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01). This indicates that there is no significant evidence of autocorrelation in the residuals.

# Forecast the next 5 periods (weeks)
forecast_arima <- forecast(arima_model, h = 5)

# Display the forecast values
print(forecast_arima)

# Calculate accuracy of the ARIMA model
accuracy_metrics <- accuracy(arima_model)

# Print the accuracy metrics
print(accuracy_metrics)
